#SlackTeams.io
SlackTeams.io is an open-source collection of publicly accessible Slack Teams & Communities.

**Want to add a team to the list?**

Our list is open-source. All it takes to contribute to the list is a pull request. Our only requirement, is that the team must have a publicly accessible URL to request an invite.

Not great with Git? Reach out to one of the contributors (from the list below) on Twitter to have a team added to the list.
